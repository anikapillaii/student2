**Python Quiz Description**

While exploring Jupyter Notebook, I was able to go through the python code for teh quiz and see how it worked. I saw that a function needed to be defined in order for the quiz to function, so I defined it and the quiz worked properly. I then used Jupyter Notebook to put that pyython code into my website.

**Problems**

- The quiz questions were a little bit too easy and didnt take much thought in order to answer
- The answers were case sensitvie and were kind of annoying if the user made the first letter capital

**Solution**

- I brainstormed new quiz problems and edited the list of questions that already existed
- I used elif to add different versions of capital letters for the answers

**Skills used/learned**

- I learned how to use Jupyter Notebook to add puthon code to the website with cells
- I used the elif function in puthon to add variations of the correct answer 

**Calculator Description**
I wanted to add a calculator to my website so I decided to code one using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to have a current operation display and a previous one right above it in smaller font that displayed the last function.

**Problems**

- I had a visual issue where whenever I clicked a new operation, the current opperation function would move to the previous function area without clicking the equals button

**Solutions**

- I deleted the previous operation div entirely which took away a lot of unnecessary complexity and made it easier to create the calculator 

**Skills used/learned**

- I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple GUI based calculator 
- I used the eval function in JavaScript to evalute the current operation and display the new answer
