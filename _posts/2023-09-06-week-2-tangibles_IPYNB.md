**Snake Game Description**

Using the source code for the snake game, I was able to add a playable and fully functioning snake fame into the website

**Problems**

- On borh localhost and github pages, I was unable to load the game page for some reason and the tab would time out
- When I had the dink theme it would cover up the game so users would be unable to play it

**Solution**

- I switched browsers and the page started working. It only was happening on chrome.
- I changed the theme back to the original one

**Skills used/learned**

- Adding HTML code to put a functioning snake game into the website

**JS Output Table Description**

I used the code from the JS Output table to create my own table that contained the World Series winners, year, Total W-L, win percentage, and position. I added a bit of styling to make it more appealing

**Problems**

- I envountered an issue where the search bar overlapped with the data table values most likely due to the fact that I styled the head of the table

**Solutions**

- In my CSS style, I added a margin so that the search bar would be moved farther up 

**Skills used/learned**

- Editing HTML to change table values
- Adding and modifying CSS to style the table and fix issues.
